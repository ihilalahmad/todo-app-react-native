A simple todo list application, built with React Native and TypeScript, offers a seamless user experience for managing tasks on the go. With the ability to add, delete, and mark todos as complete, organizing your daily responsibilities has never been easier.

Utilizing Redux for state management ensures that your todos are efficiently stored and accessible across the application. Additionally, we leverage AsyncStorage to persist todo data locally, providing users with uninterrupted access to their tasks even when offline.

Whether you're jotting down quick notes or tackling complex projects, our app empowers you to stay organized and focused throughout your day.
